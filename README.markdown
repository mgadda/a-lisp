What is Ya?
-----------

Ya is a toy lisp implemented in CoffeeScript which runs in NodeJS or in a browser. It most closely resembles common lisp, though you're bound to find plenty of places where thats not true. Its a product of my desire to learn CoffeeScript, NodeJS, and Common Lisp all at the same time.
